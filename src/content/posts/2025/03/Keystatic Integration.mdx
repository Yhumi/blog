## CMS

Naturally after starting a blog/project site the next step was integrating a CMS to be able to easily add blog posts without having to mess around too much with creating files. It also makes it a lot easier to write blogs on the go as I'm able to visit the CMS url and write them on my phone or tablet.

So I started browsing my options and it turns out, there's a lot of options. I wanted one, however, that worked well and played well with the way the theme I'm using - Spectre - works.

## Spectre's influence

Spectre is a great theme, I love it already and its made making this site a breeze, however it only works with mdx files within the content folders in Astro, a very normal way of doing it - however I didn't really want to rewrite the entire logic of the static page generation to fetch from a CMS api. This meant the options I looked at first weren't very suitable.

I originally toyed with both **Strapi** and **Sanity** however these options just weren't a great fit, and in the end I opted for Keystatic - a great, and easy to setup, git-based CMS that allowed me to easily generate mdx files that fit the format and have them directly pushed to my github repository for the blog. So now I can easily write a blog post, like this one, or a project post, and actually get what fits deployed fast!
