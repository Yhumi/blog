Transfem puppygirl developer addicted to rhythm games.

I write a lot of silly projects related to ganes I love and things I find fun in my spare time. 
Currently addicted to and hyperfocusing on rhythm games after rediscovering a love for it in March '25.

Rhythm games I play:
- Pop'n Music
- SDVX
- IIDX
- Dancerush (pls don't EOL it president yoshitaka)
- Chunithm
- Jubeat, Wacca and Nostalgia a lil..

I used to play a lot of FFXIV once upon a time, I was an end-game raider and a pretty good one at that, so if you want to talk about ff ever know my opinions are very spicy and my takes hot.
