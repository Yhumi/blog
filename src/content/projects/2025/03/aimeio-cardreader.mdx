# Starting the Project
The project initially started out with a desire to be able to scan my e-amusement pass on my PC when I'm playing chunithm on my home setup.
I bought a smartcard reader hastily without checking that it had FeLiCa support, then finally settled after reading into it on the **acr122u**.

Once I had a smartcard reader that could actually recognise the AiC card, I had assumed I'd be able to build one of the existing projects out there 
without issue and use it, however the two projects I could find ([raviddog's aimeio-pcsc](https://github.com/raviddog/aimeio-pcsc) and 
[AkaiiKitsune's aimeio-cardreader](https://github.com/AkaiiKitsune/aimeio-cardreader)) both had their issues with my setup, so I turned to forking aiemio-cardreader.

# Yhumi/aimeio-cardreader
Existing as a fork of AkaiiKitsune's work, it implements the following extras on top of the original repo:
- raviddog's FeLiCa Serial -> Mifare Access Code conversion via `aimeio-felicadb.txt`
- A better scanning system/timeout system that acknowledges when the game should have read the card, stopping any erroneous double-scanning issues.

# Building the project

Building (on linux) is as easy as installing meson & ninja, then running the following commands:
```
meson setup --cross cross-mingw-64.txt b64
ninja -C b64
```

This should output `src/libaimeio.dll` and `src/aimetest.exe`, rename libaimeio.dll -> aimeio.dll and you can use aimetest.exe to check functionality.

# Using the project

Copy `(lib)aimeio.dll` to your `chunithm/App/bin/` folder, update `segatools.ini` to add the configuration lines:

```ini
[aimeio]
path=aimeio.dll    ;Path to aimeio.dll
scan=0x0D          ;Sets the key which will be used to insert a card in game. The default is 'Return'

;Everything below this line is optional.

readerOptional=1            ;Make reader optional, so that you can still use the keyboard
readerName=ACS ACR122 0     ;Manually select which reader to use
disableBuzzer=1             ;Disable the buzzer 
;aimePath=""                ;Manually specify an aime.txt file
;felicaPath=""              ;Manually specify a felica.txt file
;debug=0                    ;Display function calls
```

Then create your `aimeio_felicadb.txt` and `aime.txt`, and have fun! ♥

### aimeio_felicadb.txt format
```
<felica1> <access_code1>
<felica2> <access_code2>
12345678 1234567890
```

### aime.txt format
```
<access_code1>
<access_code2>
```
